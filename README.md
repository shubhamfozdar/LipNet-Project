<h3>0. Install and Import Dependencies</h3>

**OpenCV-Python**:-  OpenCV-Python serves as a valuable tool in the LipNet project for various tasks ranging from preprocessing and feature extraction to visualization and debugging, ultimately contributing to the development of an accurate and robust lip reading system.

**Matplotlib**:-   Matplotlib complements OpenCV-Python in the LipNet project by providing capabilities for data visualization, model performance evaluation, feature analysis, debugging, and analysis, thus enhancing the development and understanding of the lip reading system.

**imageio**:- imageio serves as a versatile tool for handling video input/output operations in the LipNet project, facilitating tasks such as video loading, saving, format conversion, frame extraction, and real-time video processing. Its capabilities complement other libraries like OpenCV and Matplotlib, contributing to the efficient development and deployment of the lip reading system.

**gdown**:-  gdown simplifies the process of downloading datasets and pre-trained models from Google Drive, streamlining the development and experimentation process in the LipNet project for lip reading using machine learning.

# LipNet-Project
Building a Machine Learning Model that's able to perform lip reading.

<h3>0. Install and Import Dependencies</h3>

**OpenCV-Python**:- 
  In the LipNet project for lip reading using machine learning, OpenCV-Python can be used for several purposes:
  -Video Preprocessing
  -Feature Extraction
  -Lip Region Detection
  -Data Augmentation
  -Visualizations and Debugging

**Matplotlib**:-   Matplotlib complements OpenCV-Python in the LipNet project by providing capabilities for data visualization, model performance evaluation, feature analysis, debugging, and analysis, thus enhancing the development and understanding of the lip reading system.

**imageio**:- imageio serves as a versatile tool for handling video input/output operations in the LipNet project, facilitating tasks such as video loading, saving, format conversion, frame extraction, and real-time video processing. Its capabilities complement other libraries like OpenCV and Matplotlib, contributing to the efficient development and deployment of the lip reading system.

**gdown**:-  gdown simplifies the process of downloading datasets and pre-trained models from Google Drive, streamlining the development and experimentation process in the LipNet project for lip reading using machine learning.
